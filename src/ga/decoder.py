"""
Decoder for the FJSP (deterministic, no workers yet).

A chromosome is:
  - sequence: a list of job_ids, length = num_operations. The k-th occurrence
    of job_id j in this list refers to operation j's k-th operation (0-based).
    This is the standard "operation-based encoding" (Section 4.2.2 of proposal):
    any permutation is automatically precedence-feasible after decoding.
  - assignment: dict (job_id, op_index) -> machine_id, one entry per operation.

The decoder walks the sequence in order, and for each operation:
  - looks up its assigned machine
  - starts it at max(job's previous op finish time, machine's free time)
  - records finish time
Returns per-operation start/end times and the makespan.
